Hi, Iâ€™m Yehoshua Vieira, I am an 18 year old man and I live in Brazil.
I'm interested in learning more about programming, the web in general and technology topics.
I'm doing a degree in information systems, at the moment, I'm in the first semester.

I have intermediate/advanced English and intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS.
